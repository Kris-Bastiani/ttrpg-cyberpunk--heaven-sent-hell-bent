# TTRPG Wiki: "Heaven Sent / Hell Bent"

Deployed URL: TBD

Wiki for the setting of a Cyberpunk TTRPG campaign I'm going to run, published using Quartz.

Setup borrows heavily from [DefenderOfBasic's Obsidian / Quartz / GitHub Pages Template](https://github.com/DefenderOfBasic/obsidian-quartz-template).

## Getting started

To run locally, run `npm install` then:

```
npx quartz build --serve
```

Otherwise, just push to GitHub and CI will build & deploy the HTML.
